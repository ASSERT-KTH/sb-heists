# Automatic exploits for smartbugs-curated

This directory contains attacks which expoit the vulnerabilities in contracts from smartbugs-curated.

These attacks are automated using Hardhat testing framework.

## Directory structure
- `contracts/`: Contains Solidity smart contracts.
    + `<category>`: intermediate directory where `<category>` corresponds to the category of vulnerabilities.
        - `<file_name>.sol`: smart contract file from smartbugs-curated.
        - `<file_name>_attack.sol`: attacker contract w.r.t. `<file_name>.sol`

- `test/`: Contains test files. Hardhat uses Mocha testing framework by default.
    + `<category>`: intermediate directory where `<category>` corresponds to the category of vulnerabilities.
        - `<file_name>_test.js`: test simulating the attack `<file_name>_attack.sol` on `<file_name>.sol`.

- `artifacts/`: Stores compiled contract artifacts generated by Hardhat.

- `hardhat.config.js`: Configuration file for Hardhat.

## How to get started

### Prerequisites
- Nodejs with npm7+ (tested using node:v20.14.0 and npm:10.5.0)

### Installation
1. Make sure that Nodejs is installed.
2. Clone repo and go into `smartbugs-curated/0.4.x` directory.
3. Run `npm ci`.

### Running tests
- To test all the exploits run `npx hardhat test`.
- To test a specific exploit run `npx hardhat test <path_to_test>`.
